MUST BE RAN ON A SERVER because of cross origin requests.

This repo is for minified version of a visual sound kit application patatap.com. Pressing a key on keyboard generates circle at random point of the screen and plays a sound. Each key has unique circle color and sound.

The app is implemented with Paper.js and howler.js libraries.
